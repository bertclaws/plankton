# Slop Guard Mascot Research

## Decision: Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)

**Status:** Committed
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Purpose:** Brand mascot / visual metaphor for AI slop guard concept in marketing pitches

---

## 1. Problem

A universally recognizable cartoon character is needed to serve as the visual and conceptual embodiment of "slop guard" — a brand mascot for marketing pitches about Claude Code's AI quality pipeline. The character must communicate the concept of defending against AI slop (low-quality, generic LLM output) instantly to a broad, non-technical public audience through a single image and a catchy name, without requiring explanation.

## 2. Root Cause

AI tools like Claude Code generate output that sometimes includes slop. Three complementary tools form a quality pipeline:

| Tool | Role | Archetype |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | The Creator — generates output, including occasional slop | The one who creates the slop |
| **Claude Hooks** | The Snitch/Detector — catches slop automatically via event-driven validation | The one who detects and flags |
| **Claude -p** | The Fixer — processes and cleans output at scale in pipelines | The one who fixes it |

This pipeline needs a memorable, shareable, non-technical visual metaphor for broad marketing pitches that honestly acknowledges "LLMs create slop" while demonstrating the guard system catches and fixes it. The brand narrative is **intentionally vulnerability-forward**: the creator makes slop, the snitch catches it, the fixer resolves it.

## 3. Solution: Plankton (+ Karen)

**Plankton** from SpongeBob SquarePants — paired with **Karen** (his computer wife) — as the single-character mascot for the slop guard concept.

### Why Plankton Wins

| Criterion | Score | Detail |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Name maps to nature | Strong | Real plankton are tiny organisms that filter ocean water — directly paralleling tiny quality checks filtering the output pipeline |
| Goofy villain energy | Strong | Adversarial but lovable; the right tone for a slop guard (you don't want your output flagged, but you're grateful when it is) |
| Analytical + tech-obsessed | Strong | Has Karen (a literal AI/computer), analyzes obsessively, uses technology-first approaches |
| Relentlessly persistent | Strong | Never stops trying, episode after episode — the guard that never sleeps |
| Non-human | Strong | Avoids "too human" associations |
| From SpongeBob | Strong | The most recognized cartoon globally, cross-generational, cross-cultural |
| Not cliche | Strong | Zero developer-culture overuse |
| Catchy name | Strong | 2 syllables, fun to say, the word itself already carries meaning beyond the character |
| Karen pairing | Strong | Plankton + Karen = "tiny persistent analyst with an AI" — which is literally what a slop guard is |

### Pitch Framing: Turning Weaknesses into Strengths

**"He always fails"**
> Irony that works FOR the pitch: "Plankton fails because he fights AGAINST quality. Your slop guard succeeds because it fights FOR quality. Same relentless energy, right side."

**"His restaurant (Chum Bucket) serves slop"**
> "Plankton knows slop better than anyone — he's been making Chum for years. It takes a slop expert to catch slop."

**"He's a villain"**
> This is a FEATURE, not a bug. A slop guard SHOULD be adversarial. Your bad output should be AFRAID of the guard. The best quality systems are adversarial by design — hooks don't politely ask if there's slop, they catch it.

**"Visual doesn't scream guard on its own"**
> Pair him with Karen (his COMPUTER). Plankton + Karen = "tiny persistent analyst with an AI." One sentence of pitch text bridges the gap.

**"Name maps to nature"**
> Real plankton: tiny, everywhere, at the base of everything. Your slop guard: tiny checks, everywhere in your pipeline, foundational to quality.

### Tone

- **Lovable villain / antihero** energy (not heroic, not scary)
- A slop guard is fundamentally adversarial — it blocks output, rejects work, says "not good enough"
- The character you respect but don't want to encounter, because encountering it means your output has problems
- Funny, memorable, shareable

---

## 4. Verification

The solution works if:

- [ ] A single pitch slide showing Plankton (with Karen) plus a one-line caption makes a non-technical audience immediately understand "this is the thing that catches bad AI output"
- [ ] The name "Plankton" triggers associations of: tiny but everywhere, persistent, analytical, tech-equipped — without explanation
- [ ] The audience laughs/nods at the metaphor and wants to reference it later (e.g., "our code got Planktoned" / "Karen flagged your output")
- [ ] The character mappings land when presented: Plankton's energy = the guard's energy; Karen = the AI layer; Chum Bucket = where slop lives (and Plankton knows it intimately)
- [ ] The metaphor holds up across the three-tool narrative: Claude Code creates (like the Krabby Patty kitchen produces), Hooks detect (like Plankton analyzes), -p fixes (like Karen processes)

## 5. Runner-Up Options

### Statler and Waldorf (The Muppets) — Runner-Up #1

**Direction:** Prestigious critics judging from above

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Concept | THE definitive "quality critics" in pop culture |
| Visual | Two old men in a balcony looking down and judging — instant "quality critics" even to non-fans |
| Names | "Statler and Waldorf" sounds prestigious, like a law firm or quality institution |
| Dynamic | Duo of critics bouncing off each other — two layers of criticism |
| Energy | Heckler / critic — impossibly high standards, vocally reject anything mediocre |
| From | The Muppets — globally beloved |
| Not cliche | Not overused in developer culture |

**Weaknesses:**
- They NEVER fix anything — pure criticism, zero solutions
- They're from The Muppets (puppets, not traditional cartoon)
- They're old men — "old" may not fit a modern AI tool brand
- Younger audiences may not recognize them individually

**Verdict:** Strong on critic energy and prestigious naming. Weaker on action (they only complain) and age demographics.

### Mojo Jojo (Powerpuff Girls) — Runner-Up #2

**Direction:** Goofy tech villain with a real-word name

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Concept | Monkey with exposed brain, builds robots/machines obsessively |
| Visual | Monkey in cape with brain helmet and tech — "super-intelligent villain" |
| Name | "Mojo" = real word meaning personal power/magic/charm; "Mojo Jojo" is rhythmic and fun to say |
| Energy | Goofy villain who monologues in hilariously overcomplicated sentences |
| Tech | Builds robots, machines, technology obsessively |
| From | Powerpuff Girls — globally popular |
| Not cliche | Zero developer-culture overuse |

**Weaknesses:**
- Name was judged "too silly" for the brand
- Not better than Plankton on name recognition (SpongeBob >> Powerpuff Girls for broad public)
- "Mojo" doesn't map to filtering/guarding as directly as "Plankton" maps to water-filtering organisms

**Verdict:** Very strong candidate in the same lane as Plankton but slightly weaker on name gravitas and nature-mapping.

## 6. Rejected Options and Why

### Trios (Approach Abandoned)

The trio approach was abandoned because:
- Names are hard to pronounce all in one go
- Three characters don't convey the idea as immediately as a single character
- The creator/snitch/fixer dynamic felt forced with most cartoon trios

| Trio | Why Rejected |
|------|-------------|
| **Powerpuff Girls** (Blossom, Bubbles, Buttercup) | "Not the right fit" — creator/snitch/fixer mapping doesn't land naturally |
| **Tom, Jerry, and Spike** | Names don't sound catchy together when spoken aloud; characters don't always appear together |
| **Phineas, Ferb, and Candace** | Best conceptual mapping (Phineas=creator, Candace=snitch, Ferb=fixer) but names hard to pronounce, characters not visually appealing enough for one-image impact |
| **Inspector Gadget, Penny, Brain** | Perfect conceptual mapping (Gadget=incompetent creator, Penny=behind-scenes detector, Brain=field fixer) but "not what I'm looking for" — didn't click |
| **Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles** | "Overused in developer culture, cliche" despite Knuckles being a literal guardian |
| **Clumsy, Brainy, Papa Smurf** | "Smurfs feel dated" — three blue characters lack visual punch |

### Single Characters

| Character | Why Rejected |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Remy** (Ratatouille) | Strong quality-vs-slop metaphor but "the name doesn't convey an action" — "Remy" is just a French name with no real-world meaning |
| **Anton Ego** (Ratatouille) | Intimidating food critic with "Ego" as a powerful name concept, but "too human" |
| **Scrooge McDuck** (DuckTales) | "Scrooge" = real word for obsessive guardian, but "overused, cliche" |
| **Inspector Gadget** | Rejected as part of trio; individually too associated with incompetence |

## 7. Key Design Criteria (Discovered Through Interview)

These criteria emerged through 10+ rounds of clarification and should guide any future mascot decisions:

### Must-Have Criteria

1. **Name maps to real-world concept** — The character's name should be a word that already means something in the real world, and that meaning should relate to filtering/detecting/guarding (e.g., "Plankton" = organisms that filter water)
2. **Goofy villain / antihero energy** — Not heroic, not scary. Lovable villain that you respect but don't want to encounter
3. **Analytical + tech-obsessed** — The character should embody tech/science/analysis
4. **Relentlessly persistent** — Never gives up, represents a guard that never sleeps
5. **Non-human** — Cartoon creature/animal, not a human character
6. **From an extremely popular cartoon** — Must be recognized by broad public globally, not just niche fandoms
7. **Not cliche in developer culture** — No Sonic, no Mario, no characters developers already overuse
8. **Catchy name** — Easy to pronounce, fun to say, memorable
9. **Single-image visual impact** — One Google image on a pitch slide should communicate the concept with minimal text
10. **Broad public recognition** — Must work for non-technical marketing audiences, not just engineers

### Nice-to-Have Criteria

- Name sounds catchy as a catchphrase or verb ("got Planktoned")
- Character has a tech sidekick/tool (Karen = AI computer)
- Character is from a show with ongoing cultural relevance
- The "always fails" or villain angle can be reframed with irony

### Explicitly Rejected Traits

- "Too human" characters (Anton Ego)
- Cliche developer-culture references (Sonic, Scrooge McDuck)
- Trios with hard-to-pronounce combined names
- Characters that are too silly/childish (Mojo Jojo was borderline)
- Characters that are pure critics with no action (Squidward — only complains, never fixes)
- Dated characters that younger audiences won't recognize

## 8. Brand Narrative Framework

### Core Narrative (Vulnerability-Forward)

"LLMs create slop. Our tools catch and fix it."

This is intentionally honest — the brand acknowledges that Claude Code (the creator) sometimes generates low-quality output. The slop guard (Hooks + -p) exists precisely because the creator isn't perfect.

### Character-to-Tool Mapping

```
Claude Code  ──creates output──>  [Output with potential slop]
                                          │
Claude Hooks ──detects/flags──>   [Slop identified]  ← "Plankton analyzing"
                                          │
Claude -p    ──fixes/cleans──>    [Clean output]     ← "Karen processing"
```

### Pitch One-Liners (Examples)

- "Your output has met its Plankton — tiny, relentless, and it WILL find the flaw."
- "Plankton knows slop. He's been making Chum for years. Now that expertise works for YOU."
- "Same persistence. Same tech obsession. Same 'I will NEVER stop' energy. But this time, for quality."
- "Go go gadget... actually, just go Plankton. He's got Karen running the numbers."

## 9. Research Process Notes

- Interview conducted over 10+ rounds of structured clarification
- Started with trio approach (Claude Code / Hooks / -p as three characters), pivoted to single character after discovering trios are too complex for instant visual communication
- Plankton was mentioned unprompted by the user early in the process and consistently beat every alternative
- Key turning point: realizing that the character's NAME mapping to a real-world concept (plankton = water-filtering organisms) was a critical criterion the user couldn't initially articulate but kept gravitating toward
- The "goofy villain" energy was validated as the right tone through comparison with intimidating alternatives (Anton Ego) and heroic alternatives (Remy)
- The "always fails" weakness was resolved through ironic reframing rather than avoidance
